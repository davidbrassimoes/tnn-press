                <strong>Who are The Night Noises?</strong>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">The Night Noises, are a rock band that puts side by side their taste
                    for sophisticated music as well as their rock sensibilities in a truly
                    masterful and original way, always with their own personality.
                    They are originally from Lisbon, Portugal although they split their
                    activity between their home country, the Netherlands and Belgium.
                    After many years working as a freelance guitar player, João Ferreira
                    decided to start singing and writing his own songs.
                    During João’s years as a music teacher he had met David Simões,
                    guitar player and Francisco Morato, bass player, who are both rock
                    aficionados with past experiences playing with other bands.
                    Adding drummer Bruno Barrué to this line-up, whom he had met
                    during one of his gigs, gave João and his band mates the stability
                    needed to develop their artistic ideas.
                    The Night Noises create rock songs with a twist in the traditional
                    rock band recipe. Oh and lots of fuzz... They have released 6
                    singles and a live album in 2022.</p>

                    In March 2022 the band recorded a live session at the renowned Canoa
                    Studios in Portugal. The outcome of this session has been released on the
                    band’s YouTube channel and as a live album available on all the digital
                    platforms.</p>

            <strong>What I’m Here For</strong>
            <p>What I’m Here for is a lazier song about the struggle between a man chasing his goals and the things he
                had
                to do during his life that pushed him from his path. The verse, stripped down of almost every instrument
                but
                the voice, is almost like a prayer to the man’s dreams.
                The surprisingly heavy section at the ending of the song represents the man's frustrations</p>

        <div>
            <strong>I Never Wanted You</strong>
            <p>This was the first song The Night Noises ever wrote. It starts with a catchy yet mysterious vocal melody,
                one
                of those that would make an arena sing as one.
                There are mean people in this world, the situation gets bad when one of those people is someone within
                your close circle that you can’t quickly get away from. The song is about you saying: Enough!
                The chorus is repetitive and singable, the outro section gives us a relief and symbolizes the change.

        </div>
        <div>
            <strong>Let You Go</strong>
            <p>This is a powerful rock song with a simple singable hook, an angry mood and a message we can all relate
                to.
                We’ve all had “friends” that took advantage of us when it’s convenient for them. This song is about
                letting
                someone like this go away. Once and for all!
                This is a perfect display of the band’s heavier side. The musically disruptive character of this song’s
                riffs
                show us how angry we can get in a situation like this.</p>

            <strong>What You Want And What They Need</strong>
            <p>Life often throws challenges our way, sometimes they are hard to overcome. This song is an anthem to all
                of
                us who are still fighting despite all the bad things we've been through. The different changes the song
                goes
                through are exactly like the different stages of our life, some good some bad some just strange..</p>

        <div>
            <strong>True Or False</strong>
            <p>This is a song about the use of fake information to manipulate the public opinion. We live in a post
                truth world
                and we’re not sure who to trust anymore, that’s definitely scary. It’s ironic that in the age of
                information much
                of it is not trustable and there isn’t a short term solution for the problem</p>

        <div>
            <strong>Friend or Foe</strong>
            <p>When you meet someone new you can't tell how your relationship with this person will develop in the
                future.
                Maybe he or she will become a dear friend or maybe they will turn out to be your nemesis. Experience may
                tell you to be prudent when revealing your inner self to a new person you just met, but we tell you to
                go all in
                and deal with it later!</p>
